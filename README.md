# Assembly-
This project was done in my first year of my degree in Computer Architecture,
in code with the [Assembly P16](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roby2014.p16) extension, an adaptation of ARM Assembly,
an extension created by a former ISEL student.
This work really helped me to deepen my knowledge and I fell in love with Assembly.
